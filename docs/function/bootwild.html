<h2>bootwild</h2>
<pre> Performs wild bootstrap and calculates bootstrap-t confidence intervals and 
 p-values for the mean, or the regression coefficients from a linear model.

     'bootwild (y)' performs a null hypothesis significance test for the
     mean of y being equal to 0. This function implements wild bootstrap-t
     resampling of Webb's 6-point distribution of the residuals, and computes
     p-values after imposing the null hypothesis (H0) [1-4]. The following
     statistics are printed to the standard output:
        - original: the mean of the data vector y
        - std_err: heteroscedasticity-consistent standard error(s)
        - CI_lower: lower bound(s) of the 95% bootstrap-t confidence interval
        - CI_upper: upper bound(s) of the 95% bootstrap-t confidence interval
        - tstat: Student's t-statistic
        - pval: two-tailed p-value(s) for the parameter(s) being equal to 0
        - fpr: minimum false positive risk for the corresponding p-value
          By default, the confidence intervals are symmetric, two-sided
          bootstrap-t confidence intervals. The p-values are computed
          following both of the guidelines by Hall and Wilson [5]. The minimum
          false positive risk (FPR) is computed according to the Sellke-Berger
          approach as described in [6,7].

     'bootwild (y, X)' also specifies the design matrix (X) for least squares
     regression of y on X. X should be a column vector or matrix the same
     number of rows as y. If the X input argument is empty, the default for X
     is a column of ones (i.e. intercept only) and thus the statistic computed
     reduces to the mean (as above). The statistics calculated and returned in
     the output then relate to the coefficients from the regression of y on X.

     'bootwild (y, X, CLUSTID)' specifies a vector or cell array of numbers
     or strings respectively to be used as cluster labels or identifiers.
     Rows in y (and X) with the same CLUSTID value are treated as clusters
     with dependent errors. Rows of y (and X) assigned to a particular
     cluster will have identical resampling during wild bootstrap. If empty
     (default), no clustered resampling is performed and all errors are
     treated as independent. The standard errors computed are cluster robust.

     'bootwild (y, X, BLOCKSZ)' specifies a scalar, which sets the block size
     for bootstrapping when the residuals have serial dependence. Identical
     resampling occurs within each (consecutive) block of length BLOCKSZ
     during wild bootstrap. Rows of y (and X) within the same block are
     treated as having dependent errors. If empty (default), no block
     resampling is performed and all errors are treated as independent.
     The standard errors computed are cluster robust.

     'bootwild (y, X, ..., NBOOT)' specifies the number of bootstrap resamples,
     where NBOOT must be a positive integer. If empty, the default value of
     NBOOT is 1999.

     'bootwild (y, X, ..., NBOOT, ALPHA)' is numeric and sets the lower and
     upper bounds of the confidence interval(s). The value(s) of ALPHA must
     be between 0 and 1. ALPHA can either be:
        o scalar: To set the (nominal) central coverage of SYMMETRIC
                  bootstrap-t confidence interval(s) to 100*(1-ALPHA)%.
                  For example, 0.05 for a 95% confidence interval.
        o vector: A pair of probabilities defining the (nominal) lower and
                  upper bounds of ASYMMETRIC bootstrap-t confidence interval(s)
                  as 100*(ALPHA(1))% and 100*(ALPHA(2))% respectively. For
                  example, [.025, .975] for a 95% confidence interval.
        The default value of ALPHA is the scalar: 0.05, for a symmetric 95%
        bootstrap-t confidence interval.

     'bootwild (y, X, ..., NBOOT, ALPHA, SEED)' initialises the Mersenne
     Twister random number generator using an integer SEED value so that
     'bootwild' results are reproducible.

     'bootwild (y, X, ..., NBOOT, ALPHA, SEED, L)' multiplies the regression
     coefficients by the hypothesis matrix L. If L is not provided or is empty,
     it will assume the default value of 1 (i.e. no change to the design). 

     'STATS = bootwild (...) returns a structure with the following fields:
     original, std_err, CI_lower, CI_upper, tstat, pval, fpr and the sum-of-
     squared error (sse).

     '[STATS, BOOTSTAT] = bootwild (...)  also returns a vector (or matrix) of
     bootstrap statistics (BOOTSTAT) calculated over the bootstrap resamples
     (before studentization).

     '[STATS, BOOTSTAT, BOOTSSE] = bootwild (...)  also returns a vector
     containing the sum-of-squared error for the fit on each bootstrap 
     resample.
