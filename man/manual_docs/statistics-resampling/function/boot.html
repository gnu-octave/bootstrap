<pre> This function returns resampled data or indices created by balanced bootstrap 
 or bootknife resampling.

 -- Function File: BOOTSAM = boot (N, NBOOT)
 -- Function File: BOOTSAM = boot (X, NBOOT)
 -- Function File: BOOTSAM = boot (..., NBOOT, LOO)
 -- Function File: BOOTSAM = boot (..., NBOOT, LOO, SEED)
 -- Function File: BOOTSAM = boot (..., NBOOT, LOO, SEED, WEIGHTS)

     'BOOTSAM = boot (N, NBOOT)' generates NBOOT bootstrap samples of length N.
     The samples generated are composed of indices within the range 1:N, which
     are chosen by random resampling with replacement [1]. N and NBOOT must be
     positive integers. The returned value, BOOTSAM, is a matrix of indices,
     with N rows and NBOOT columns. The efficiency of the bootstrap simulation
     is ensured by sampling each of the indices exactly NBOOT times, for first-
     order balance [2-3]. Balanced resampling only applies when NBOOT > 1.

     'BOOTSAM = boot (X, NBOOT)' generates NBOOT bootstrap samples, each the
     same length as X (N). X must be a numeric vector, and NBOOT must be
     positive integer. BOOTSAM is a matrix of values from X, with N rows
     and NBOOT columns. The samples generated contains values of X, which
     are chosen by balanced bootstrap resampling as described above [1-3].
     Balanced resampling only applies when NBOOT > 1.

     'BOOTSAM = boot (..., NBOOT, LOO)' sets the resampling method. If LOO
     is false, the resampling method used is balanced bootstrap resampling.
     If LOO is true, the resampling method used is balanced bootknife
     resampling [4]. The latter involves creating leave-one-out jackknife
     samples of size N - 1, and then drawing resamples of size N with
     replacement from the jackknife samples, thereby incorporating Bessel's
     correction into the resampling procedure. LOO must be a scalar logical
     value. The default value of LOO is false.

     'BOOTSAM = boot (..., NBOOT, LOO, SEED)' sets a seed to initialize
     the pseudo-random number generator to make resampling reproducible between
     calls to the boot function. Note that the mex function compiled from the
     source code boot.cpp is not thread-safe. Below is an example of a line of
     code one can run in Octave/Matlab before attempting parallel operation of
     boot.mex in order to ensure that the initial random seeds of each thread
     are unique:
       • In Octave:
            pararrayfun (nproc, @boot, 1, 1, false, 1:nproc)
       • In Matlab:
            ncpus = feature('numcores'); 
            parfor i = 1:ncpus; boot (1, 1, false, i); end;

     'BOOTSAM = boot (..., NBOOT, LOO, SEED, WEIGHTS)' sets a weight
     vector of length N. If WEIGHTS is empty or not provided, the default 
     is a vector of length N, with each element equal to NBOOT (i.e. uniform
     weighting). Each element of WEIGHTS is the number of times that the
     corresponding index (or element in X) is represented in BOOTSAM.
     Therefore, the sum of WEIGHTS must equal N * NBOOT.
